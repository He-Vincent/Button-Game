# Button-Game

This is the first game I have ever created. I started this project to understand the game development process and to use the python GUI.

The goal of this game: to watch the computer's moves of pressing the buttons from white to red, and changing back to white, and then the user pressing the same sequence of moves. It starts with the computer doing 4 random moves, and the user having a limited time to click the same sequence. If the sequences match, it displays "success" to the screen. If the user exceeds the time limit or clicks an inaccurate sequence, it will display "fail" to the screen. If the user is successful, after a short pause, the computer then does 5 random moves, and so on.

How to Run the game:

1. Click on my Button-Game repository
2. Click on the "clone or download" button on my Button-Game repository
3. Click "Download Zip"
4. Extract it and double-click "buttongame.exe"
5. A "Windows protected your PC" pop up will appear
6. Click "More info"
7. Click "Run anyway"
